# Application Layer

- The application layer in the OSI model is the closest layer to the end user which means that the application layer and end user can interact directly with the software application.
- This layer allows users to send data, access data and use networks.
- The application layer programs are based on client and servers.

##### Functions of the application layer

- Identifying communication partners
- Determining resource availability
- Synchronizing communication

##### Services of Application Layers

1. Mail Services
- An application layer provides Email forwarding and storage.
2. Directory Services
- An application contains a distributed database that provides access for global information about various objects and services.
3. Authentication
- It authenticates the sender or receiver's message or both.
4. File Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM)
- An application allows a user to access files in a remote computer, to retrieve files from a computer and to manage files in a remote computer. 
- FTAM defines a hierarchical virtual file in terms of file structure, file attributes and the kind of operations performed on the files and their attributes.
5. Network Virtual terminal
- An application layer allows a user to log on to a remote host.

##### Application layer protocols 
1. Telnet
2. FTP
3. SMTP
4. DNS
5. DHCP

# Network Applications

- A Network application is an application running on one host and provides
communication to another application running on a different host.
- A network application development is writing programs that run on
different end systems and communicate with each other over the network.
- In the Web application, there are two distinct programs that communicate with each
other: the browser program running in the user's host; and the Web server program
running in the Web server host.

###### Examples of network applications are
- e-mail
- web
- text messaging
- remote login
- P2P file sharing
- multi-user network games
- streaming stored video (YouTube)
- voice over IP (e.g., Skype)
- real-time video conferencing
- social networking
