# Computer Network

- A computer network is a system in which multiple computers are connected to each other to
share information and resources.
- The connection between networked computing devices is established using either cable
media or wireless media. 

# Advantages of Computer Networks

- Central Storage of Data 
- Anyone can connect to a computer network 
- Faster Problem-solving 
- Reliability 
- It is highly flexible 
- Security through Authorization 
- It boosts storage capacity 

# Disadvantages of Computer Networks

- It lacks robustness 
- It lacks independence 
- Virus and Malware 
- Cost of the network 

# Type of Computer Network

| Basis                | LAN                                                           | MAN                                                        | WAN                                                                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Full-Form            | LAN stands for local area network.                            | MAN stands for metropolitan area network.                  | WAN stands for wide area network.                                             |
| Geographic Span      | Operates in small areas such as the same building or campus.  | Operates in large areas such as a city.                    | Operates in larger areas such as country or continent.                        |
| Ownership            | LAN’s ownership is private.                                   | MAN’s ownership can be private or public.                  | While WAN also might not be owned by one organization.                        |
| Transmission Speed   | The transmission speed of a LAN is high.                      | While the transmission speed of a MAN is average.          | Whereas the transmission speed of a WAN is low.                               |
| Propagation delay    | The propagation delay is short in a LAN.                      | There is a moderate propagation delay in a MAN.            | Whereas, there is a long propagation delay in a WAN.                          |
| Congestion           | There is less congestion in LAN.                              | While there is more congestion in MAN.                     | Whereas there is more congestion than MAN in WAN.                             |
| Design & Maintenance | LAN’s design and maintenance are easy.                        | While MAN’s design and maintenance are difficult than LAN. | Whereas WAN’s design and maintenance are also difficult than LAN as well MAN. |
| Fault tolerance      | There is more fault tolerance in LAN.                         | While there is less fault tolerance.                       | In WAN, there is also less fault tolerance.                                   |

# Internet

- The internet is a type of world-wide computer network.
- The internet is the collection of infinite numbers of connected computers that are spread across
the world.
- It is established as the largest network and sometimes called a network of a network.
- The Internet is a global computer network providing a variety of information and
communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized
communication protocols.
- When two computers are connected over the Internet, they can send and receive all kinds of
information such as text, graphics, voice, video, and computer programs.

# Protocol

- A protocol is a set of rules that manages data communications.
- Protocols define methods of communication, how to communicate when to communicate etc.
- A protocol is an agreement between the communicating parties on how communication is to
proceed.
- Important elements of protocols are
- 1. Syntax 2. Semantics 3. Timing
