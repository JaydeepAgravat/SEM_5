# 1. Which are the Software quality standards? Explain any one.

- Quality: developed product meets it’s specification.
- List of Quality Standards:
1. ISO 9000
2. CMM
3. Six Sigma

#### CMM (Capability Maturity Model)
- To determine an organization’s current state of process maturity, the SEI (Software Engineering Institute) uses an assessment that results in a five point grading scheme
- The grading scheme determines compliance with a capability maturity model (CMM) that defines key activities required at different levels of process maturity
- The SEI approach establishes five process maturity levels that are defined in the following manner

###### Level 1: Initial
- The software process is characterized as ad hoc and occasionally
- Few processes are defined and success depends on individual effort
###### Level 2: Repeatable
- Basic project management processes are established to track cost, schedule, and functionality.
- The necessary process discipline is in place to repeat earlier successes on Project
###### Level 3: Defined
- The software process for both management and engineering activities is documented, standardized and integrated
- This level includes all characteristics defined for level 2
###### Level 4: Managed
- Detailed measures of the software process and product quality are collected
- This level includes all characteristics defined for level 3
###### Level 5: Optimizing
- Continuous process improvement is enabled by quantitative feedback from the process and from testing innovative ideas and technologies
- This level includes all characteristics defined for level 4

# 3. What is the importance of user interface? Discuss user interface design rules.

### User interface
- User interface is the front-end application view to which user interacts in order to use the software.
- The software becomes more popular if its user interface is:
1. Attractive
2. Simple to use
3. Responsive in short time
4. Clear to understand
5. Consistent on all interface screens
- There are two types of User Interface:
1. Command Line Interface: 
2. Graphical User Interface:

### Importance of user interface
1. Attracting and acquiring new customers
2. A boost in customer retention 
3. Lower customer support expenses
4. Lower costs for development
5. Higher customer satisfaction

### User interface design rules

1. Place the User in Control
- Define interaction modes in a way that does not force a user into unnecessary or undesired
- Provide for flexible interaction.
- Allow user interaction to be interruptible and undoable.
- Streamline interaction as skill levels advance and allow the interaction to be customized.
- Hide technical internals from the casual user.
- Design for direct interaction with objects that appear on the screen.

2. Reduce the User’s Memory Load
- Reduce demand on short-term memory.
- Establish meaningful defaults.
- Define shortcuts that are intuitive.
- The visual layout of the interface should be based on a real-world metaphor.
- Disclose information in a progressive fashion.

3. Make the Interface Consistent
- Allow the user to put the current task into a meaningful context.
- Maintain consistency across a family of applications.
- If past interactive models have created user expectations, do not make changes unless there is a compelling reason to do so.
