# 1. Which are the Software quality standards? Explain any one.

- Quality: developed product meets it’s specification.
- List of Quality Standards:
1. ISO 9000
2. CMM
3. Six Sigma

#### CMM (Capability Maturity Model)
- To determine an organization’s current state of process maturity, the SEI (Software Engineering Institute) uses an assessment that results in a five point grading scheme
- The grading scheme determines compliance with a capability maturity model (CMM) that defines key activities required at different levels of process maturity
- The SEI approach establishes five process maturity levels that are defined in the following manner

##### Level 1: Initial
- The software process is characterized as ad hoc and occasionally
- Few processes are defined and success depends on individual effort
##### Level 2: Repeatable
- Basic project management processes are established to track cost, schedule, and functionality.
- The necessary process discipline is in place to repeat earlier successes on Project
##### Level 3: Defined
- The software process for both management and engineering activities is documented, standardized and integrated
- This level includes all characteristics defined for level 2
##### Level 4: Managed
- Detailed measures of the software process and product quality are collected
- This level includes all characteristics defined for level 3
##### Level 5: Optimizing
- Continuous process improvement is enabled by quantitative feedback from the process and from testing innovative ideas and technologies
- This level includes all characteristics defined for level 4
