# 1. What is the importance of SQA? Discuss SQA activities.

#### SQA

- Software quality assurance (often called quality management) is an umbrella activity that is applied throughout the software process.
- It is planned and systematic pattern of activities necessary to provide high degree of confidence in the quality of a product.
- Software quality assurance (SQA) encompasses:
  1. An SQA process.
  2. Specific quality assurance and quality control tasks.
  3. Effective software engineering practice.
  4. Control of all software work products and the changes made to them.
  5. A procedure to ensure compliance with software development standards.
  6. Measurement and reporting mechanisms.


#### Importance of SQA

1. SQA produces high quality software. 
2. High quality application saves time and cost. 
3. SQA is beneficial for better reliability. 
4. SQA is beneficial in the condition of no maintenance for a long time. 
5. High quality commercial software increase market share of company. 
6. Improving the process of creating software. 
7. Improves the quality of the software. 

#### SQA Activities

1. Prepare an SQA plan for a project
2. Participate in the development of the projectâ€™s software process description
3. Review software engineering activities to verify compliance with the defined software process
4. Audit designated software work products to verify compliance with those defined as part of the software process
5. Ensure that deviations in software work and work products are documented and handled according to a documented procedure.
6. Records any noncompliance and reports to senior management

# 2. Reverse Engineering

- Software Reverse Engineering is a process of recovering the design, requirement specifications and functions of a product from an analysis of its code.
- The purpose of reverse engineering is to facilitate the maintenance work by improving the understandability of a system and to produce the necessary documents for a legacy system. 

#### Reverse Engineering Goals: 

- Cope with Complexity.
- Recover lost information.
- Detect side effects.
- Synthesise higher abstraction.
- Facilitate Reuse.

#### Steps of Software Reverse Engineering: 

- Collection Information: 
- Examining the information: 
- Extracting the structure: 
- Recording the functionality: 
- Recording data flow: 
- Recording control flow: 
- Review extracted design: 
- Generate documentation: 
 
#### Reverse Engineering Tools:

- CIAO and CIA: 
- Rigi
- Bunch
- GEN++
- PBS

# 3. What is DevOps? How it works? What are the DevOps principles & best practices?

#### DevOps

- DevOps is a software development methodology that improves the collaboration between developers and operations teams using various automation tools.
- These automation tools are implemented using various stages which are a part of the DevOps Lifecycle.
- DevOps bridges the gap between the operation team & development team, which generally used to work in isolation with another.
- The main aim of DevOps is to provide continuous & high-quality delivery of the software by making shortening SDLC

#### How DevOps Works?

- The DevOps Lifecycle divides the SDLC lifecycle into the following stages:
1. Continuous Development:
2. Continuous Integration:
3. Continuous Deployment:
4. Continuous Testing:
5. Continuous Monitoring:
6. Continuos operations
7. Continuos Feedback

#### Devops Practices

1. Process automation
2. Continuous Integration (CI)
3. Continuous Delivery (CD)
4. Continuous Deployment
5. Infrastructure as code
6. Microservices
7. Configuration management and many more.

#### Devops Principles

- DevOps principles guide how to organize a DevOps environment.

1. Incremental Releases
2. Automation
3. DevOps Pipeline
4. Continuous Integration
5. Continuous Delivery
6. Continuous Monitoring
7. Feedback Sharing
8. Version Control
9. Collaboration

# 4. Write short note on Version Control. 

- Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code. 

- **Example** : Git, Helix core, Microsoft TFS,


#### Types of Version Control Systems: 

1. Local Version Control Systems
2. Centralized Version Control Systems
3. Distributed Version Control Systems

#### Purpose of Version Control: 

- Multiple people can work simultaneously on a single project.
- It integrates the work that is done simultaneously by different members of the team
- Version control provides access to the historical versions of a project.
- It can be easily known when, why, and by whom any part of a file was edited.

#### Benefits of the version control system:

- Enhances the project development speed by providing efficient collaboration.
- Reduce possibilities of errors through traceability to every small change.
- Informs us about Who, What, When, Why changes have been made.
- Helps in recovery in case of any disaster or contingent situation.

# 5. Re-engineering.

- When we need to update the software to keep it to the current market, without impacting its functionality, it is called software re-engineering.
- It is a process where the design of software is changed and programs are re-written
- Legacy software cannot keep tuning with the latest technology available in the market
  - For example, initially UNIX was developed in assembly language. When language C came into existence, UNIX was re-engineered in C, because working in assembly language was difficult.
- Other than this, sometimes programmers notice that few parts of software need more maintenance than others and they also need re-engineering.
- Decide what to re-engineer.
  - Is it whole software or a part of it?
- Perform Reverse Engineering, in order to obtain specifications of existing software
- Restructure Program if required
  - For example, changing function-oriented programs into object-oriented programs and re-structure data as required
- Apply Forward engineering concepts in order to get re-engineered software

# 6. Explain Formal Technical Review.

- A formal technical review (FTR) is a software quality control activity performed by software engineers (and others).

#### The objectives of an FTR are:
1. To uncover errors in function, logic, or implementation; for any representation of the software
2. To verify that the software under review meets its requirements
3. To ensure that the software has been represented according to predefined standards
4. To achieve software that is developed in a uniform manner
5. To make projects more manageable

- During the FTR,
  - a reviewer (the recorder) actively records all issues that have been raised
- These are summarized at the end of the review meeting, and a reviewed issues list is produced
- In addition, a formal technical review summary report is completed
