# 1. What is the importance of SQA? Discuss SQA activities.

#### SQA

- Software quality assurance (often called quality management) is an umbrella activity that is applied throughout the software process.
- It is planned and systematic pattern of activities necessary to provide high degree of confidence in the quality of a product.
- Software quality assurance (SQA) encompasses:
  1. An SQA process.
  2. Specific quality assurance and quality control tasks.
  3. Effective software engineering practice.
  4. Control of all software work products and the changes made to them.
  5. A procedure to ensure compliance with software development standards.
  6. Measurement and reporting mechanisms.


#### Importance of SQA

1. SQA produces high quality software. 
2. High quality application saves time and cost. 
3. SQA is beneficial for better reliability. 
4. SQA is beneficial in the condition of no maintenance for a long time. 
5. High quality commercial software increase market share of company. 
6. Improving the process of creating software. 
7. Improves the quality of the software. 

#### SQA Activities

1. Prepare an SQA plan for a project
2. Participate in the development of the projectâ€™s software process description
3. Review software engineering activities to verify compliance with the defined software process
4. Audit designated software work products to verify compliance with those defined as part of the software process
5. Ensure that deviations in software work and work products are documented and handled according to a documented procedure.
6. Records any noncompliance and reports to senior management

# 2. Reverse Engineering

- Software Reverse Engineering is a process of recovering the design, requirement specifications and functions of a product from an analysis of its code.
- The purpose of reverse engineering is to facilitate the maintenance work by improving the understandability of a system and to produce the necessary documents for a legacy system. 

#### Reverse Engineering Goals: 

- Cope with Complexity.
- Recover lost information.
- Detect side effects.
- Synthesise higher abstraction.
- Facilitate Reuse.

#### Steps of Software Reverse Engineering: 

- Collection Information: 
- Examining the information: 
- Extracting the structure: 
- Recording the functionality: 
- Recording data flow: 
- Recording control flow: 
- Review extracted design: 
- Generate documentation: 
 
#### Reverse Engineering Tools:

- CIAO and CIA: 
- Rigi
- Bunch
- GEN++
- PBS
